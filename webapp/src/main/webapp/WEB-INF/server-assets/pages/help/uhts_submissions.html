            <h3><a id="DataTypes"></a>1. Types of data that can be submitted</h3>
            <p>ArrayExpress accepts submissions of functional genomics data generated using high throughput sequencing (HTS) assays like RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, mostly from <strong>non-human and human non-identifiable</strong> samples, with the following exceptions:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data: please submit to the <a href="/metagenomics/submission">EBI Metagenomics service</a> for optimised organisation of your meta-data (e.g. sample annotation).</li>
            <li>De novo assembly of transcriptome: the raw RNA-seq reads should be submitted to ArrayExpress. Once we have finished processing your raw reads, submit the assembled transcriptome file (often in fasta format) directly to the <a href="/embl/genomes/submission/app/login/login.jsf">European Nucleotide Archive</a>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you have potentially identifiable human data, please <a href="#HumanIdentifiableData">see below</a>.</p>

            <p>To submit to ArrayExpress, all you need to do is send us meta-data for your experiment (e.g. experiment description, samples and their attributes, all protocols used) and the raw data files; see the <a href="#HowToSubmit">submission guide below</a>. Submissions without raw data files will not be accepted unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p>The meta-data about your experiment will be stored at ArrayExpress, and the raw data files (e.g. fastq files) are stored at the <a href="/ena/about/sra_submissions">Sequence Read Archive</a> (SRA) of the <a href="/ena/">European Nucleotide Archive</a> (ENA). ArrayExpress will transfer the raw data files to the ENA for you so you <i>do not</i> need to submit those files separately to the ENA. You can also send us processed data (i.e. processed from the raw reads, e.g. BAM alignment files, differential expression data, expression values linked to genome coordinates, etc).  Depending on the file format, it will either be stored at ArrayExpress or the ENA.  <span style="color:red">Given the split of meta-data and data files between ArrayExpress and ENA, once your submission is fully processed, it is a lengthy process to modify/update it. Some changes (e.g. cancelling an ENA record which has been released to the public) will not be possible.  Please take a look at our <a href="modify_data_loaded_in_AE.html">sequencing experiment update/cancellation policy</a> before proceeding.</span></p>

            <h4><a id="HumanIdentifiableData"></a>Potentially identifiable human data</h4>
            <p>Data from human samples and individuals that can potentially lead to the identification of the donors (e.g. genomic DNA sequences) can be submitted to ArrayExpress if consent for public release of the data hs been given. Such approvals typically would be given by the relevant ethics committees and <em>ensuring this is the responsibility of the submitters</em>.</p>
            <p>Identifiable data approved for <a href="/ega/submission/FAQ#DAC">controlled access</a> should be submitted directly to the <a href="/ega/">European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)</a>, not ArrayExpress. Cases are possible where identifiable data (e.g. raw sequences) are submitted to the EGA, while the related processed data (e.g. RPKM values) are submitted to ArrayExpress, but <em>it is up to the submitter to ensure that such a submission complies with the respective ethics requirements.</em>  To submit processed data to ArrayExpress, please begin by emailing us at <a href="mailto:arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk">arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk</a> with the EGA study accession number. We will import non-human-identifiable meta-data from EGA in a spreadsheet (which the submitter will have the chance to review), and then match the meta-data with processed data.</p>
            <p>The following diagram summarises the typical data flow:</p>

            <h3 id="HowToSubmit">2. What data files to submit, and how</h3>
            <p>To start a submission to go the <a href="/fg/annotare/login">Annotare webform submission tool</a> and start a submission.</p>

            <h4 id="meta_data">Experiment meta-data</h4>
            <p>Apart from the <a href="submissions_overview.html">experiment description and sample annotation</a>, sequencing experiments require further details describing the sequencing    library (as they are needed for ENA submission). Please see <a href="www.ebi.ac.uk/fgpt/annotare_help/seq_lib_spec.html">this guide</a> for more information about the library specifications.</p>

            <h4 id="raw_data_files">Raw data file requirements</h4>
            <p>Please provide individual <strong>unprocessed</strong> raw data files for each sample. After demultiplexing and trimming of adapter sequences do <i>not</i> remove entire sequence reads or trim by quality score. Prepare your files according to <a href='/ena/about/read-file-formats'>ENA specifications</a>. This is a developing field so please do check the specifications every time you submit a new experiment. Data files which do not satisfy ENA's requirements will not be accepted.</p>
            <p>For <strong>FASTQ</strong> files, each file must be individually compressed by gzip or bzip2. Do not bundle multiple fastq files into one archive. For paired-end experiments, if the mate pairs are in two separate files (one file for the forward strand, one for the reverse strand), the two files must be named with the same root and end with extensions such as <code>_1.fq.gz</code> and <code>_2.fq.gz</code>. Examples of naming styles supported by the ENA:            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>sampleA<strong>_1</strong>.fq.gz / sampleA<strong>_2</strong>.fq.gz</li>
              <li>sampleA<strong>_F</strong>.fq.gz / sampleA<strong>_R</strong>.fq.gz</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you're submitting raw data files in <strong>BAM</strong> format, please make sure they satisfy <a href="/ena/about/read-file-formats#bam_format">ENA  specifications</a> as well as the following conditions:</p>
            <ol><li>Each file contains all reads from the sequencing machine, regardless of whether the reads mapped to the reference genome. The reason for this is that we would expect the BAM file to be used to regenerate <i>all</i> the sequencing reads.</li>
            <li>The phred quality score for each base should be included in the file.</li>
            <li>If you have data from paired-end sequencing libraries, for each sequencing run, include data for both mate reads in one single bam file.</li></ol>
            <p>If your BAM files contain only mapped reads, then please either create "full" (unfiltered) BAM files, or send us the original read files (e.g. fastq.gz files) as raw data files (again, check <a href='/ena/about/read-file-formats'>ENA specifications</a>). BAM files containing only mapped reads can be included in your submission as processed files, as long as they satisfy ENA's specification and that the reference genome used for alignment has been accessioned in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, involving <a href="http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp">DDBJ</a>, <a href="/ena">ENA</a>, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a>).</p>

            <h4 id="processed_data">Processed data files</h4>
            <p>If your processed data are in spreadsheets, e.g. a table of FPKM values for genes with genes in rows and samples in columns, please save them in tab-delimited text (*.txt) format (not Excel). We also accept BAM alignment files. There is no need to compress or zip up the processed files one by one or as a bundle. Upload them in Annotare and assign to your samples in the same way as you would for <a href="#sending_raw_files">raw files</a> (see below).</p>

            <h4 id="sending_raw_files">File upload</h4>
            <p style="color:red">UPDATE (17th March 2016):<br>New direct upload feature in Annotare and new FTP path</p>
            <p>You can upload raw and processed sequencing files <strong>directly in Annotare</strong>. Use "drag-and-drop" to place files in the upload frame or click <code>"Upload files..."</code> to select the files to be transferred. </p>
            <p>If you prefer, you may still use the FTP upload function, but note that the private <strong>FTP directory is unique for each submission</strong>. Before starting to transfer files, go to the <code>"Samples and Data"</code> > <code>"Upload and assign data files"</code> section in Annotare and click <code>"FTP Upload..."</code>. The dialogue will show you the ftp directory for your submission (e.g. <code>ftp-private.ebi.ac.uk/ibtd1rmo-20r7k3g747sup/</code>). Then copy the data files to this directory following the <a href="ftp_upload.html">FTP transfer instructions</a>. Please transfer the compressed files one by one (and not bundling multiple fastq.gz files in one tar.gz archive) to avoid time-out issues and to allow us to process your files promptly.

            To associate the transferred files with your experiment submission and ensure the file integrity, and follow the on-screen instructions of the dialogue and fill in file names and their corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 checksums</a> (remember to use the checksum of the actual compressed file that is sent to us). Annotare will then verify the presence of the files on our FTP site and the MD5 checksums. If verification passes, you will be able to assign data files to each of your samples. Here are some examples how to caclulate MD5 checksums: <a href="http://www.winmd5.com/">Windows user example</a>, <a href="http://www.resourcesforlife.com/docs/item1428">Mac user example</a>, <a href="http://heatware.net/linux-unix/how-to-create-md5-checksums-and-validate-a-file-in-linux/">Linux user example</a>.</p>
